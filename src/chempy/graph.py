    performed:

    * If `subgraph` is ``True``, the isomorphism function will treat `graph2`
    as a subgraph of `graph1`. In this instance a   subgraph can either mean a
    smaller graph (i.e. fewer vertices and/or edges) or a less specific graph.

    mapping. This mapping will be preserved in all returned valid
    isomorphisms.
